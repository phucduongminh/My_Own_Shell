//note for ifconfig cmd
This program takes a single command-line argument, which is the name of the network interface to retrieve information for. It first creates a socket using the socket() system call with the AF_INET address family, the SOCK_DGRAM socket type, and a protocol of 0. It then creates a struct ifreq variable, and sets the ifr_name field to the interface name specified in the command-line argument.

The program then uses the ioctl() system call with the SIOCGIFADDR flag to retrieve the IP address of the interface, and prints it to the console using the inet_ntoa() function. It then retrieves the netmask and hardware (MAC) address in the same way, and prints them to the console as well.
